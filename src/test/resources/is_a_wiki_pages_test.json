DeGeneres starred in a series of films for a show named ''[[Ellen's Energy Adventure]]'', which is part of the [[Universe of Energy]] attraction and pavilion at [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Epcot]]. The film also featured [[Bill Nye]], [[Alex Trebek]], [[Michael Richards]], and [[Jamie Lee Curtis]]. The show revolved around DeGeneres' falling asleep and finding herself in an energy-themed version of ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', playing against an old rival, portrayed by Curtis, and [[Albert Einstein]]. The next film had DeGeneres co-hosting an educational look at energy with Nye. The ride first opened on September 15, 1996, as ''Ellen's Energy Crisis'', but was quickly given the more positive-sounding name ''Ellen's Energy Adventure''.\n\n==Television career==\n\nDeGeneres's first regular TV role was in a short-lived Fox sitcom called ''[[Open House (1989 TV series)|Open House]]''. She played the role of Margo Van Meter, an office worker at the Juan Verde Real Estate company. The show co-starred [[Alison LaPlaca]] and [[Mary Page Keller]]. In 1992, producers [[Neal Marlens]] and [[Carol Black]] cast DeGeneres in their sitcom ''[[Laurie Hill (TV series)|Laurie Hill]]'', in the role of Nurse Nancy MacIntyre. The series was canceled after only four episodes, but Marlens and Black were so impressed with DeGeneres' performance that they soon cast her in their next ABC pilot, ''These Friends of Mine'', which they co-created with [[David S. Rosenthal]].\n\n[[File:Ellen DeGeneres 2.jpg|thumb|At the Governor's Ball after the 46th Annual Emmy Awards telecast, September 1994]]\nDeGeneres's comedy career became the basis of the successful sitcom ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'', named ''These Friends of Mine'' during its first season. The [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] show was popular in its first few seasons due in part to DeGeneres's style of [[observational comedy|observational humor]]; it was often referred to as a \"female ''[[Seinfeld]]''.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/07/lgbt-history-month-icon-ellen-degeneres_n_1940831.html |title=GLBT History Month – Ellen DeGeneres |accessdate=November 28, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010224041/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/07/lgbt-history-month-icon-ellen-degeneres_n_1940831.html |archivedate=October 10, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n''Ellen'' reached its height of popularity in April 1997, when DeGeneres came out as a lesbian on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''.

DeGeneres returned to stand-up comedy and later re-established herself as a successful talk show host.\n\nDeGeneres returned to television in 2001 with a new [[CBS]] sitcom, ''[[The Ellen Show]]''. DeGeneres launched a daytime television talk show, ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]],'' in September 2003. One of several celebrity-hosted talk shows surfacing at the beginning of that season, including those of [[Sharon Osbourne]] and [[Rita Rudner]], her show has consistently risen in the [[Nielsen ratings]] and received widespread critical praise. It was nominated for 11 [[Emmy Award|Daytime Emmy Awards]] in its first season, winning four, including Best Talk Show. The show has won 25 [[Emmy Awards]] for its first three seasons on the air. DeGeneres is known for her dancing and singing with the audience at the beginning of the show and during commercial breaks. She often gives away free prizes and trips to be in her show's studio audience with the help of her sponsors.\n\nDeGeneres celebrated her thirty-year class reunion by flying her graduating class to California to be guests on her show in February 2006. She presented Atlanta High School with a surprise gift of a new electronic [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] marquee sign. In May 2006, DeGeneres made a surprise appearance at the [[Tulane University]] commencement in New Orleans. Following [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton]] to the podium, she came out in a bathrobe and furry slippers. \"They told me everyone would be wearing robes,\" she said. Ellen then went on to make another [[commencement speech]] at Tulane in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e8ToRVOtRo|title=Ellen's Commencement Speech at Tulane, 2009|publisher=Youtube.com|date=April 28, 2010|accessdate=December 27, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe show broadcast for a week from Universal Studios Orlando in March 2007. Skits included DeGeneres going on the Hulk Roller Coaster Ride and the Jaws Boat Ride. In May 2007, DeGeneres was placed on [[bed rest]] due to a torn ligament in her back.  She continued hosting her show from a hospital bed, tended to by a nurse, explaining \"the show must go on, as they say.\"  Guests sat in hospital beds as well.

The authors claimed that within three or five years, machine translation would be a solved problem.<ref>{{cite web|author=Hutchins, J.|year=2005|url=http://ahs.annaisd.org/common/pages/GalleryPhoto.aspx?photoId=11772950&width=180&height=180|title=The history of machine translation in a nutshell}}{{self-published source|date=December 2013}}</ref>  However, real progress was much slower, and after the [[ALPAC|ALPAC report]] in 1966, which found that ten-year-long research had failed to fulfill the expectations, funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced.  Little further research in machine translation was conducted until the late 1980s, when the first [[statistical machine translation]] systems were developed.\n\nSome notably successful NLP systems developed in the 1960s were [[SHRDLU]], a natural-language system working in restricted \"[[blocks world]]s\" with restricted vocabularies, and [[ELIZA]], a simulation of a [[Rogerian psychotherapy|Rogerian psychotherapist]], written by [[Joseph Weizenbaum]] between 1964 and 1966.  Using almost no information about human thought or emotion, ELIZA sometimes provided a startlingly human-like interaction. When the \"patient\" exceeded the very small knowledge base, ELIZA might provide a generic response, for example, responding to \"My head hurts\" with \"Why do you say your head hurts?\".\n\nDuring the 1970s, many programmers began to write \"conceptual ontologies\", which structured real-world information into computer-understandable data.  Examples are MARGIE (Schank, 1975), SAM (Cullingford, 1978), PAM (Wilensky, 1978), TaleSpin (Meehan, 1976), QUALM (Lehnert, 1977), Politics (Carbonell, 1979), and Plot Units (Lehnert 1981).  During this time, many [[chatterbots]] were written including [[PARRY]], [[Racter]], and [[Jabberwacky]].\n\nUp to the 1980s, most NLP systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules.  Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in NLP with the introduction of [[machine learning]] algorithms for language processing.  This was due to both the steady increase in computational power (see [[Moore's law]]) and the gradual lessening of the dominance of [[Noam Chomsky|Chomskyan]] theories of linguistics (e.g. [[transformational grammar]]), whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of [[corpus linguistics]] that underlies the machine-learning approach to language processing.<ref>Chomskyan linguistics encourages the investigation of \"[[corner case]]s\" that stress the limits of its theoretical models (comparable to [[pathological (mathematics)|pathological]] phenomena in mathematics), typically created using [[thought experiment]]s, rather than the systematic investigation of typical phenomena that occur in real-world data, as is the case in [[corpus linguistics]].  The creation and use of such [[text corpus|corpora]] of real-world data is a fundamental part of machine-learning algorithms for NLP.  In addition, theoretical underpinnings of Chomskyan linguistics such as the so-called \"[[poverty of the stimulus]]\" argument entail that general learning algorithms, as are typically used in machine learning, cannot be successful in language processing.  As a result, the Chomskyan paradigm discouraged the application of such models to language processing.</ref> Some of the earliest-used machine learning algorithms, such as [[decision tree]]s, produced systems of hard if-then rules similar to existing hand-written rules.  However, [[Part of speech tagging|part-of-speech tagging]] introduced the use of [[hidden Markov models]] to NLP, and increasingly, research has focused on [[statistical models]], which make soft, [[probabilistic]] decisions based on attaching [[real-valued]] weights to the features making up the input data. The [[cache language model]]s upon which many [[speech recognition]] systems now rely are examples of such statistical models.  Such models are generally more robust when given unfamiliar input, especially input that contains errors (as is very common for real-world data), and produce more reliable results when integrated into a larger system comprising multiple subtasks.\n\nMany of the notable early successes occurred in the field of [[machine translation]], due especially to work at IBM Research, where successively more complicated statistical models were developed.  These systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual [[text corpus|textual corpora]] that had been produced by the [[Parliament of Canada]] and the [[European Union]] as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems of government.  However, most other systems depended on corpora specifically developed for the tasks implemented by these systems, which was (and often continues to be) a major limitation in the success of these systems. As a result, a great deal of research has gone into methods of more effectively learning from limited amounts of data.\n\nRecent research has increasingly focused on [[unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] and [[semi-supervised learning]] algorithms.  Such algorithms are able to learn from data that has not been hand-annotated with the desired answers, or using a combination of annotated and non-annotated data.  Generally, this task is much more difficult than [[supervised learning]], and typically produces less accurate results for a given amount of input data.  However, there is an enormous amount of non-annotated data available (including, among other things, the entire content of the [[World Wide Web]]), which can often make up for the inferior results.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a flurry of results showing [[deep learning]] techniques<ref name=goldberg:nnlp17>Goldberg, Yoav (2016).

Four revolutions.] Language Log, February 5, 2011. </ref>\nin the late 1980s and mid 1990s, much Natural-Language Processing research has relied heavily on [[machine learning]].\n\nFormerly, many language-processing tasks typically involved the direct hand coding of rules,<ref name=winograd:shrdlu71>Winograd, Terry (1971). Procedures as a Representation for Data in a Computer Program for Understanding Natural Language. http://hci.stanford.edu/winograd/shrdlu/</ref><ref name=schank77>Roger C. Schank and Robert P. Abelson (1977). Scripts, plans, goals, and understanding: An inquiry into human knowledge structures</ref> which is not in general robust to natural-language variation.  The machine-learning paradigm calls instead for using [[statistical inference]] to automatically learn such rules through the analysis of large ''[[text corpus|corpora]]'' of typical real-world examples (a ''corpus'' (plural, \"corpora\") is a set of documents, possibly with human or computer annotations).\n\nMany different classes of machine learning algorithms have been applied to NLP tasks.  These algorithms take as input a large set of \"features\" that are generated from the input data. Some of the earliest-used algorithms, such as [[decision tree]]s, produced systems of hard if-then rules similar to the systems of hand-written rules that were then common.  Increasingly, however, research has focused on [[statistical models]], which make soft, [[probabilistic]] decisions based on attaching [[real-valued]] weights to each input feature.   Such models have the advantage that they can express the relative certainty of many different possible answers rather than only one, producing more reliable results when such a model is included as a component of a larger system.\n\nSystems based on machine-learning algorithms have many advantages over hand-produced rules:\n*The learning procedures used during machine learning automatically focus on the most common cases, whereas when writing rules by hand it is often not at all obvious where the effort should be directed.\n*Automatic learning procedures can make use of statistical inference algorithms to produce models that are robust to unfamiliar input (e.g. containing words or structures that have not been seen before) and to erroneous input (e.g. with misspelled words or words accidentally omitted).  Generally, handling such input gracefully with hand-written rules—or more generally, creating systems of hand-written rules that make soft decisions—is extremely difficult, error-prone and time-consuming.\n*Systems based on automatically learning the rules can be made more accurate simply by supplying more input data.  However, systems based on hand-written rules can only be made more accurate by increasing the complexity of the rules, which is a much more difficult task.  In particular, there is a limit to the complexity of systems based on hand-crafted rules, beyond which the systems become more and more unmanageable.  However, creating more data to input to machine-learning systems simply requires a corresponding increase in the number of man-hours worked, generally without significant increases in the complexity of the annotation process.\n\n==Major evaluations and tasks==\nThe following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in NLP.  Note that some of these tasks have direct real-world applications, while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks.\n\nThough NLP tasks are obviously very closely intertwined, they are frequently, for convenience, subdivided into categories. A coarse division is given below.\n\n===Syntax===\n; [[Lemmatisation|Lemmatization]]\n; [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphological segmentation]]: Separate words into individual [[morpheme]]s and identify the class of the morphemes.  The difficulty of this task depends greatly on the complexity of the [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (i.e. the structure of words) of the language being considered. [[English language|English]] has fairly simple morphology, especially [[inflectional morphology]], and thus it is often possible to ignore this task entirely and simply model all possible forms of a word (e.g. \"open, opens, opened, opening\") as separate words.  In languages such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]] or [[Meitei language|Meitei]],<ref>Kishorjit, N., Vidya Raj RK., Nirmal Y., and Sivaji B. (2012) \"[http://aclweb.org/anthology//W/W12/W12-5008.pdf Manipuri Morpheme Identification]\", Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on South and Southeast Asian Natural Language Processing (SANLP), pages 95–108, COLING 2012, Mumbai, December 2012</ref> a highly [[Agglutination|agglutinated]] Indian language, however, such an approach is not possible, as each dictionary entry has thousands of possible word forms.\n; [[Part-of-speech tagging]]: Given a sentence, determine the [[part of speech]] for each word.  Many words, especially common ones, can serve as multiple [[parts of speech]].  For example, \"book\" can be a [[noun]] (\"the book on the table\") or [[verb]] (\"to book a flight\"); \"set\" can be a [[noun]], [[verb]] or [[adjective]]; and \"out\" can be any of at least five different parts of speech.  Some languages have more such ambiguity than others.  Languages with little [[inflectional morphology]], such as [[English language|English]], are particularly prone to such ambiguity. [[Chinese language|Chinese]] is prone to such ambiguity because it is a [[tonal language]] during verbalization. Such inflection is not readily conveyed via the entities employed within the orthography to convey intended meaning.\n; [[Parsing]]: (see also: [[Stochastic grammar]]) Determine the [[parse tree]] (grammatical analysis) of a given sentence.  The [[grammar]] for [[natural language]]s is [[ambiguous]] and typical sentences have multiple possible analyses.  In fact, perhaps surprisingly, for a typical sentence there may be thousands of potential parses (most of which will seem completely nonsensical to a human). There are two primary types of parsing, Dependency Parsing and Constituency Parsing. Dependency Parsing focuses on the relationships between words in a sentence (marking things like Primary Objects and predicates), whereas Constituency Parsing focuses on building out the Parse Tree using a [[Probabilistic_context-free_grammar|Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar]] (PCFG). \n; [[Sentence breaking]] (also known as [[sentence boundary disambiguation]]): Given a chunk of text, find the sentence boundaries.  Sentence boundaries are often marked by [[Full stop|period]]s or other [[punctuation mark]]s, but these same characters can serve other purposes (e.g. marking [[abbreviation]]s).\n; [[Stemming]]\n; [[Word segmentation]]: Separate a chunk of continuous text into separate words.  For a language like [[English language|English]], this is fairly trivial, since words are usually separated by spaces.  However, some written languages like [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Thai language|Thai]] do not mark word boundaries in such a fashion, and in those languages text segmentation is a significant task requiring knowledge of the [[vocabulary]] and [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of words in the language.\n; [[Terminology extraction]]: The goal of terminology extraction is to automatically extract relevant terms from a given corpus.\n\n===Semantics===\n; [[Lexical semantics]]: What is the computational meaning of individual words in context?\n; [[Machine translation]]: Automatically translate text from one human language to another.  This is one of the most difficult problems, and is a member of a class of problems colloquially termed \"[[AI-complete]]\", i.e. requiring all of the different types of knowledge that humans possess (grammar, semantics, facts about the real world, etc.) in order to solve properly.\n; [[Named entity recognition]] (NER): Given a stream of text, determine which items in the text map to proper names, such as people or places, and what the type of each such name is (e.g. person, location, organization).  Note that, although [[capitalization]] can aid in recognizing named entities in languages such as English, this information cannot aid in determining the type of named entity, and in any case is often inaccurate or insufficient.  For example, the first word of a sentence is also capitalized, and named entities often span several words, only some of which are capitalized.  Furthermore, many other languages in non-Western scripts (e.g. [[Chinese language|Chinese]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) do not have any capitalization at all, and even languages with capitalization may not consistently use it to distinguish names. For example, [[German language|German]] capitalizes all [[noun]]s, regardless of whether they refer to names, and [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] do not capitalize names that serve as [[adjective]]s.\n; [[Natural language generation]]: Convert information from computer databases or semantic intents into readable human language.\n; [[Natural language understanding]]: Convert chunks of text into more formal representations such as [[first-order logic]] structures that are easier for [[computer]] programs to manipulate. Natural-language understanding involves the identification of the intended semantic from the multiple possible semantics which can be derived from a natural-language expression which usually takes the form of organized notations of natural-language concepts. Introduction and creation of language metamodel and ontology are efficient however empirical solutions. An explicit formalization of natural-language semantics without confusions with implicit assumptions such as [[closed-world assumption]] (CWA) vs. [[open-world assumption]], or subjective Yes/No vs. objective True/False is expected for the construction of a basis of semantics formalization.<ref>Yucong Duan, Christophe Cruz (2011), ''[http://www.ijimt.org/abstract/100-E00187.htm Formalizing Semantic of Natural Language through Conceptualization from Existence]''. International Journal of Innovation, Management and Technology(2011) 2 (1), pp. 37-42.</ref>\n; [[Optical character recognition]] (OCR): Given an image representing printed text, determine the corresponding text.\n; [[Question answering]]: Given a human-language question, determine its answer.  Typical questions have a specific right answer (such as \"What is the capital of Canada?\"), but sometimes open-ended questions are also considered (such as \"What is the meaning of life?\"). Recent works have looked at even more complex questions.<ref>\"[https://www.academia.edu/2475776/Versatile_question_answering_systems_seeing_in_synthesis Versatile question answering systems: seeing in synthesis]\", Mittal et al., IJIIDS, 5(2), 119-142, 2011.</ref>\n; [[Textual entailment|Recognizing Textual entailment]]: Given two text fragments, determine if one being true entails the other, entails the other's negation, or allows the other to be either true or false.<ref name=rte:11> PASCAL Recognizing Textual Entailment Challenge (RTE-7) https://tac.nist.gov//2011/RTE/ </ref>\n; [[Relationship extraction]]: Given a chunk of text, identify the relationships among named entities (e.g. who is married to whom).\n; [[Sentiment analysis]]: Extract subjective information usually from a set of documents, often using online reviews to determine \"polarity\" about specific objects. It is especially useful for identifying trends of public opinion in the social media, for the purpose of marketing.\n; [[Topic segmentation]] and recognition: Given a chunk of text, separate it into segments each of which is devoted to a topic, and identify the topic of the segment.\n; [[Word sense disambiguation]]: Many words have more than one [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]; we have to select the meaning which makes the most sense in context.  For this problem, we are typically given a list of words and associated word senses, e.g. from a dictionary or from an online resource such as [[WordNet]]. \n\n===Discourse===\n; [[Automatic summarization]]: Produce a readable summary of a chunk of text.  Often used to provide summaries of text of a known type, such as articles in the financial section of a newspaper.\n; [[Coreference|Coreference resolution]]: Given a sentence or larger chunk of text, determine which words (\"mentions\") refer to the same objects (\"entities\"). [[Anaphora resolution]] is a specific example of this task, and is specifically concerned with matching up [[pronoun]]s with the nouns or names to which they refer. The more general task of coreference resolution also includes identifying so-called \"bridging relationships\" involving [[referring expression]]s. For example, in a sentence such as \"He entered John's house through the front door\", \"the front door\" is a referring expression and the bridging relationship to be identified is the fact that the door being referred to is the front door of John's house (rather than of some other structure that might also be referred to).\n; [[Discourse analysis]]: This rubric includes a number of related tasks.  One task is identifying the [[discourse]] structure of connected text, i.e. the nature of the discourse relationships between sentences (e.g. elaboration, explanation, contrast).  Another possible task is recognizing and classifying the [[speech act]]s in a chunk of text (e.g. yes-no question, content question, statement, assertion, etc.).\n\n===Speech===\n; [[Speech recognition]]: Given a sound clip of a person or people speaking, determine the textual representation of the speech.  This is the opposite of [[text to speech]] and is one of the extremely difficult problems colloquially termed \"[[AI-complete]]\" (see above).  In [[natural speech]] there are hardly any pauses between successive words, and thus [[speech segmentation]] is a necessary subtask of speech recognition (see below).  Note also that in most spoken languages, the sounds representing successive letters blend into each other in a process termed [[coarticulation]], so the conversion of the [[analog signal]] to discrete characters can be a very difficult process.\n; [[Speech segmentation]]: Given a sound clip of a person or people speaking, separate it into words.  A subtask of [[speech recognition]] and typically grouped with it.\n; [[Text-to-speech]]\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|3}}\n*[[Automated essay scoring]]\n*[[Biomedical text mining]]\n*[[Compound term processing]]\n*[[Computational linguistics]]\n*[[Computer-assisted reviewing]]\n*[[Controlled natural language]]\n*[[Deep learning]]\n*[[Deep linguistic processing]]\n*[[Foreign language reading aid]]\n*[[Foreign language writing aid]]\n*[[Information extraction]]\n*[[Information retrieval]]\n*[[Language technology]]\n*[[Latent Dirichlet allocation|Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)]]\n*[[Latent semantic indexing]]\n*[[List of natural language processing toolkits]]\n*[[Native-language identification]]\n*[[Natural language programming]]\n*[[Natural language user interface|Natural language search]]\n*[[Query expansion]]\n*[[Reification (linguistics)]]\n*[[Semantic folding]]\n*[[Speech processing]]\n*[[Spoken dialogue system]]\n*[[Text-proofing]]\n*[[Text simplification]]\n*[[Thought vector]]\n*[[Truecasing]]\n*[[Question answering]]\n*[[Word2vec]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n<!-- In alphabetical order of by last name -->\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite journal|last1=Bates|first1=M|year=1995|title=Models of natural language understanding|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=92|issue=22|pages=9977–9982|doi=10.1073/pnas.92.22.9977}}\n*Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper (2009).

Several films, notably ''[[Muriel's Wedding]]'' (1994) and ''[[The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]]'' (1994), further revived interest in the group and spawned several [[tribute band]]s. In 1999, ABBA's music was adapted into the successful musical ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'' that toured worldwide. [[Mamma Mia! (film)|A film of the same name]], released in 2008, became the highest-grossing film in the United Kingdom that year.\n\nABBA were honoured at the 50th anniversary celebration of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] in 2005, when their hit \"[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]\" was chosen as the best song in the competition's history.<ref name=50th/> The group was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-quick16-2009dec16,0,6237547.story |title=ABBA Makes Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Los Angeles Times 16&nbsp;December 2009 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=16 December 2009 |accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref> In 2015, their song \"[[Dancing Queen]]\" was inducted into the [[Recording Academy]]'s [[Grammy Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/news/grammy-hall-of-fame-class-of-2015|title=GRAMMY Hall Of Fame Class Of 2015|date=16 December 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===1958–1970: Before ABBA===\n{{See also|Hep Stars|Hootenanny Singers}}\n{{multiple image\n| footer = Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus in promotional photos for different musical groups\n| footer_align = center\n| align  = right\n| image1 = Hep Stars 1967.jpg\n| width1 = 185\n| caption1 = Andersson (second from right) with the [[Hep Stars]]\n| image2 = Hootenanny singers 1967.jpg\n| width2 = 239\n| caption2 = Ulvaeus (centre) with the [[Hootenanny Singers]]\n}}\n\n====Member origins and collaboration====\n[[Benny Andersson]] (born 16 December 1946 in [[Stockholm]], Sweden) became (at age 18) a member of a popular Swedish pop-rock group, the [[Hep Stars]], that performed covers, amongst other things, of international hits. The Hep Stars were known as \"the Swedish Beatles\".<ref>[http://www.virginmedia.com/music/pictures/profiles/ten-things-abba.php?ssid=4 10 Things You Never Knew About Abba]. Virginmedia.com. Retrieved 19 April 2014.</ref> They also set up Hep House, their equivalent of [[Apple Corps]]. Andersson played the keyboard and eventually started writing original songs for his band, many of which became major hits, including \"No Response\" that hit number-three in 1965, \"Sunny Girl\", \"Wedding\", and \"Consolation\", all of which hit number-one in 1966.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=86–87}}</ref> Andersson also had a fruitful songwriting collaboration with [[Lasse Berghagen]], with whom he wrote his first [[Svensktoppen]] entry, \"Sagan om lilla Sofie\" (\"The Story of Little Sophie\"), in 1968.\n\n[[Björn Ulvaeus]] (born 25 April 1945 in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden) also began his musical career at 18 (as a singer and guitarist), when he fronted [[the Hootenanny Singers]], a popular Swedish [[folk music|folk]]&ndash;[[skiffle]] group. Ulvaeus started writing English-language songs for his group, and even had a brief solo career alongside. The Hootenanny Singers and the Hep Stars sometimes crossed paths while touring. In June 1966, Ulvaeus and Andersson decided to write a song together. Their first attempt was \"Isn't It Easy to Say\", a song later recorded by the Hep Stars. [[Stig Anderson]] was the manager of the Hootenanny Singers and founder of the [[Polar Music]] label. He saw potential in the collaboration, and encouraged them to write more. The two also began playing occasionally with the other's bands on stage and on record, although it was not until 1969 that the pair wrote and produced some of their first real hits together: \"[[Ljuva sextital]]\" (\"Sweet Sixties\"), recorded by Brita Borg, and the Hep Stars' 1969 hit \"Speleman\" (\"Fiddler\").\n\nAndersson wrote and submitted the song \"Hej, Clown\" for [[Melodifestivalen 1969]], the national festival to select the [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest|Swedish entry]] to the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. The song tied for first place, but re-voting relegated Andersson's song to second place.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=110}}</ref> On that occasion Andersson briefly met his future spouse, singer [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]], who also participated in the contest. A month later, the two had become a couple. As their respective bands began to break up during 1969, Andersson and Ulvaeus teamed up and recorded their first album together in 1970, called ''[[Lycka]]'' (\"Happiness\"), which included original songs sung by both men. Their spouses were often present in the recording studio, and sometimes added backing vocals; Fältskog even co-wrote a song with the two. Ulvaeus still occasionally recorded and performed with the Hootenanny Singers until the middle of 1974, and Andersson took part in producing their records.\n\n[[Agnetha Fältskog]] (born 5 April 1950 in [[Jönköping]], Sweden) sang with a local dance band headed by Bernt Enghardt who sent a demo recording of the band to Karl Gerhard Lundkvist. The demo tape featured a song written and sung by Agnetha: \"Jag var så kär\". Lundkvist was so impressed with her voice that he was convinced she would be a star. After going through considerable effort to locate the singer, he arranged for Agnetha to come to Stockholm and to record two of her own songs. This led to Agnetha at the age of 18 having a number-one record in Sweden with a self-composed song, which later went on to sell over 80,000 copies. She was soon noticed by the critics and songwriters as a talented singer/songwriter of [[schlager music|schlager]] style songs. Fältskog's main inspiration in her early years were singers such as [[Connie Francis]]. Along with her own compositions, she recorded [[Cover version|covers]] of foreign hits and performed them on tours in Swedish [[folkpark]]s. Most of her biggest hits were self-composed, which was quite unusual for a female singer in the 1960s. Agnetha released four solo LPs between 1968 and 1971. She had many successful singles in the Swedish charts.\n\nDuring filming of a Swedish TV special in May 1969, Fältskog met Ulvaeus, and they married on 6 July 1971. Fältskog and Ulvaeus eventually were involved in each other's recording sessions,<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=162}}</ref> and soon even Andersson and Lyngstad added backing vocals to her third studio album, ''Som jag är'' (''As I Am'') (1970). In 1972, Fältskog starred as [[Mary Magdalene]] in the original Swedish production of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' and attracted favourable reviews. Between 1967 and 1975, Fältskog released five studio albums.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=112–129 and 135–136}}</ref>\n\n[[Anni-Frid Lyngstad|Anni-Frid \"Frida\" Lyngstad]] (born 15 November 1945 in Bjørkåsen in [[Ballangen]], Norway) sang from the age of 13 with various dance bands, and worked mainly in a jazz-oriented cabaret style. She also formed her own band, the Anni-Frid Four. In the middle of 1967, she won a national talent competition with \"En ledig dag\" (\"A Day Off\") a Swedish version of the bossa nova song \"A Day in Portofino\", which is included in the EMI compilation ''[[Frida 1967–1972]]''. The first prize was a recording contract with [[EMI]] Sweden and to perform live on the most popular TV shows in the country. This TV performance, amongst many others, is included in the 3½-hour documentary ''[[Frida – The DVD]]''. Lyngstad released several [[schlager]] style singles on EMI without much success. When Benny Andersson started to produce her recordings in 1971, she had her first number-one single, \"Min egen stad\" (\"My Own Town\"), written by Benny and featuring all the future ABBA members on backing vocals. Lyngstad toured and performed regularly in the folkpark circuit and made appearances on radio and TV. She met Ulvaeus briefly in 1963 during a talent contest, and Fältskog during a TV show in early 1968.\n\nLyngstad linked up with her future bandmates in 1969. On 1 March 1969, she participated in the Melodifestival, where she met Andersson for the first time. A few weeks later they met again during a concert tour in southern Sweden and they soon became a couple. Andersson produced her single \"Peter Pan\" in September 1969&mdash;her first collaboration with Benny & Björn, as they had written the song. Andersson would then produce Lyngstad's debut studio album, ''[[Frida (album)|Frida]]'', which was released in March 1971. Lyngstad also played in several revues and cabaret shows in Stockholm between 1969 and 1973. After ABBA formed, she recorded another successful album in 1975, ''[[Frida ensam]]'', which included a Swedish rendition of \"[[Fernando (song)|Fernando]]\", a hit on the Swedish radio charts before the English version was released.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=41–58}}</ref>\n\n====First live performance and the start of \"Festfolket\"====\nAn attempt at combining their talents occurred in April 1970 when the two couples went on holiday together to the island of Cyprus. What started as singing for fun on the beach ended up as an improvised live performance in front of the United Nations soldiers stationed on the island. Andersson and Ulvaeus were at this time recording their first album together, ''Lycka'', which was to be released in September 1970. Fältskog and Lyngstad added backing vocals on several tracks during June, and the idea of their working together saw them launch a stage act, \"Festfolket\" (which translates from Swedish to mean both \"Party People\" and \"Engaged Couples\"), on 1 November 1970 in [[Gothenburg]].\n\nThe cabaret show attracted generally negative reviews, except for the performance of the Andersson and Ulvaeus hit \"Hej, gamle man\" (\"Hello, Old Man\")–the first Björn and Benny recording to feature all four. They also performed solo numbers from respective albums, but the lukewarm reception convinced the foursome to shelve plans for working together for the time being, and each soon concentrated on individual projects again.\n\n====First record together \"Hej, gamle man\"====\n\"Hej, gamle man\", a song about an old [[Salvation Army]] soldier, became the quartet's first hit. The record was credited to '''Björn & Benny''' and reached number-five on the sales charts and number one on [[Svensktoppen]], staying there for 15 weeks.\n\nIt was during 1971 that the four artists began working together more, adding vocals to the others' recordings. Fältskog, Andersson and Ulvaeus toured together in May, while Lyngstad toured on her own. Frequent recording sessions brought the foursome closer together during the summer.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=163–170}}</ref>\n\n===1970–1973: Forming the group===\nAfter the 1970 release of ''Lycka'', two more singles credited to 'Björn & Benny' were released in Sweden, \"Det kan ingen doktor hjälpa\" (\"No Doctor Can Help with That\") and \"Tänk om jorden vore ung\" (\"Imagine If the Earth Were Young\"), with more prominent vocals by Fältskog and Lyngstad–and moderate chart success.\n\nFältskog and Ulvaeus, now married, started performing together with Andersson on a regular basis at the Swedish folkparks in the middle of 1971.\n\n[[Stig Anderson]], founder and owner of [[Polar Music]], was determined to break into the mainstream international market with music by Andersson and Ulvaeus. \"One day the pair of you will write a song that becomes a worldwide hit\", he predicted.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=150}}</ref> Stig Anderson encouraged Ulvaeus and Andersson to write a song for Melodifestivalen, and after two rejected entries in 1971,<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=173}}</ref> Andersson and Ulvaeus submitted their new song \"Säg det med en sång\" (\"Say It with a Song\") for the 1972 contest, choosing newcomer Lena Anderson to perform. The song came in third place, encouraging Stig Anderson, and became a hit in Sweden.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=174}}</ref>\n\nThe first signs of foreign success came as a surprise, as the Andersson and Ulvaeus single \"She's My Kind of Girl\" was released through [[Epic Records]] in Japan in March 1972, giving the duo a Top 10 hit. Two more singles were released in Japan, \"En Carousel\"<!-- When the song was released in Japan for the first time, its title was \"En Carousel\", not \"En Karusell\". --><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/viewimages?release=1149457 |title=Cover Art for Björn and Benny Single \"En Carousel\"/\"Lycka\" |publisher=discogs |accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref> (\"En Karusell\" in Scandinavia, an earlier version of \"Merry-Go-Round\") and \"Love Has Its Ways\" (a song they wrote with [[Kōichi Morita (songwriter)|Kōichi Morita]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=182}}</ref>\n\n====First hit as Björn & Benny, Agnetha & Anni-Frid/Frida====\nUlvaeus and Andersson persevered with their songwriting and experimented with new sounds and vocal arrangements. \"[[People Need Love]]\" was released in June 1972, featuring guest vocals by the women, who were now given much greater prominence. Stig Anderson released it as a single, credited to ''Björn & Benny, Agnetha & Anni-Frid''. The song peaked at number 17 in the Swedish combined single and album charts, enough to convince them they were on to something.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=185}}</ref> The single also became the first record to chart for the quartet in the United States, where it peaked at number 114 on the ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' singles chart and number 117 on the ''[[Record World]]'' singles chart. Labeled as ''Björn & Benny (with Svenska Flicka)'', it was released there through [[Playboy Records]]. However, according to Stig Anderson, \"People Need Love\" could have been a much bigger American hit, but a small label like Playboy Records did not have the distribution resources to meet the demand for the single from retailers and radio programmers.<ref>Interview with ''Songwriter'' magazine, 6, 1981, pp.23–25.</ref>\n\nThe foursome decided to record their first album together in late 1972, and sessions began on 26 September 1972. The women shared lead vocals on \"Nina, Pretty Ballerina\" (a top ten hit in Austria) that day, and their voices in harmony for the first time gave the foursome an idea of the quality of their combined talents.\n\n====\"Ring Ring\"====\n[[File:ABBA - Popzien 1973 4.png|thumb|left|ABBA (known as Björn & Benny Agnetha & Anni-Frid/Frida) at Popzien, 1973]]\nIn 1973, the band and their manager Stig Anderson decided to have another try at Melodifestivalen, this time with the song \"[[Ring Ring (song)|Ring Ring]]\". The studio sessions were handled by [[Michael B. Tretow]], who experimented with a \"[[wall of sound]]\" production technique that became the wholly new sound. Stig Anderson arranged an English translation of the lyrics by [[Neil Sedaka]] and Phil Cody and they thought this would be a surefire winner. However, on 10 February 1973, the song came third in Melodifestivalen; thus it never reached the Eurovision Song Contest itself. Nevertheless, the group released their debut studio album, also called ''[[Ring Ring (album)|Ring Ring]]''. The album did well and the \"Ring Ring\" single was a hit in many parts of Europe and also in South Africa. However, Stig Anderson felt that the true breakthrough could only come with a UK or US hit.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=191–211}}</ref>\n\nWhen Agnetha Fältskog gave birth to her first child in 1973, she was replaced for a short period by Inger Brundin on a trip to West Germany.\n\n====Official naming====\nIn 1973, Stig Anderson, tired of unwieldy names, started to refer to the group privately and publicly as ABBA. At first, this was a play on words, as [[Abba Seafood|Abba]] is also the name of a well-known fish-canning company in Sweden, and itself an acronym. However, since the fish-canners were unknown outside Sweden, Anderson came to believe the name would work in international markets. A competition to find a suitable name for the group was held in a Gothenburg newspaper and it was officially announced in the summer that the group were to be known as \"ABBA.\" The group negotiated with the canners for the rights to the name.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=210}}</ref> \"ABBA\" is an [[acronym]] formed from the first letters of each group member's first name: Agnetha, Björn, Benny and Anni-Frid.<ref name=\"official_bio_2\">{{cite web|title=ABBA's biography, page 2 |publisher=abbasite.com |url=http://www.abbasite.com/people/bio.php?id=395&page=2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030626205305/http://www.abbasite.com/people/bio.php?id=395&page=2 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 June 2003 |accessdate=16 January 2008 }}</ref> The earliest known example of \"ABBA\" written on paper is on a recording session sheet from the Metronome Studio in [[Stockholm]] dated 16 October 1973. This was first written as \"Björn, Benny, Agnetha & Frida\", but was subsequently crossed out with \"ABBA\" written in large letters on top.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n====Official logo====\n[[File:Logo ABBA.svg|right|thumb|This well-known logo for ABBA was designed by Rune Söderqvist in 1976]]\nTheir official logo, distinct with the backward ‘B', was designed by Rune Söderqvist, who designed most of ABBA’s record sleeves. The logo first appeared on the French compilation album, Golden Double Album, released in May 1976 by [[Disques Vogue]], and would henceforth be used for all official releases.<ref>Abba Fan Club Magazine, Helga van de Kar, \"1976 – Year in Review,\" December 2016, p. 12</ref>\n\nThe idea for the official logo was made by the German photographer Wolfgang \"Bubi\" Heilemann ([[:de:Wolfgang Heilemann|de]]) on a velvet jumpsuit photo shoot for the teenage magazine [[Bravo (magazine)|Bravo]]. On the photo, the ABBA members held a giant initial letter of his/her name. After the pictures were made, Heilemann found out that Benny Andersson reversed his letter \"B\"; this prompted discussions about the mirrored \"B\", and the members of ABBA agreed on the mirrored letter. From 1976 onwards, the first 'B' in the logo version of the name was \"mirror-image\" reversed on the band's promotional material, thus becoming the group's [[registered trademark]].\n\nFollowing their acquisition of the group's catalogue, PolyGram began using variations of the ABBA logo, using a different font and adding a crown emblem to it in 1992 for the first release of the ''ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits'' compilation. When Universal Music purchased PolyGram (and, thus, ABBA's label Polar Music International), control of the group's catalogue was returned to Stockholm. Since then, the original logo has been reinstated on all official products.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080721023557/http://abbamail.com/feature/logo25th.htm ABBA Logo 25th Anniversary] Retrieved from Internet Archive 10 January 2014.</ref>\n\n===1973–1976: Breakthrough===\n\n====Eurovision Song Contest 1974====\n[[File:ABBA - TopPop 1974 1.png|thumb|right|ABBA on Dutch TV in April 1974: Clockwise from top left [[Benny Andersson]], [[Björn Ulvaeus]], [[Agnetha Fältskog]] and [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]]]] \nAs the group entered the Melodifestivalen with \"[[Ring Ring (song)|Ring Ring]]\" but failed to qualify as the 1973 Swedish entry, Stig Anderson immediately started planning for the 1974 contest.\n\nUlvaeus, Andersson and Stig Anderson believed in the possibilities of using the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] as a way to make the music business aware of them as songwriters, as well as the band itself. In late 1973, they were invited by Swedish television to contribute a song for the [[Melodifestivalen 1974]] and from a number of new songs, the upbeat song \"[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]\" was chosen; the group was now inspired by the growing [[glam rock]] scene in England.\n\nABBA won their national heats on Swedish television on 9 February 1974, and with this third attempt were far more experienced and better prepared for the Eurovision Song Contest. Winning the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974 Contest]] on 6 April 1974 gave ABBA the chance to tour Europe and perform on major television shows; thus the band saw the \"Waterloo\" single chart in many European countries. \"Waterloo\" was ABBA's first number-one single in big markets such as the UK and West Germany. In the United States, the song peaked at number-six on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, paving the way for their first album and their first trip as a group there. Albeit a short promotional visit, it included their first performance on American television, ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]''. The album ''[[Waterloo (album)|Waterloo]]'' only peaked at number 145 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, but received unanimous high praise from the US critics: ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it \"a compelling and fascinating debut album that captures the spirit of mainstream pop quite effectively … an immensely enjoyable and pleasant project\", while ''[[Creem]]'' characterised it as \"a perfect blend of exceptional, lovable compositions\".{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nABBA's follow-up single, \"[[Honey, Honey]]\", peaked at number 27 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and was a number-two hit in West Germany. However, in the United Kingdom, ABBA's British record label, Epic, decided to re-release a remixed version of \"Ring Ring\" instead of \"Honey, Honey\", and a cover version of the latter by [[Sweet Dreams (1970s band)|Sweet Dreams]] peaked at number 10. Both records debuted on the UK chart within one week of each other. \"Ring Ring\" failed to reach the Top 30 in the United Kingdom, increasing growing speculation that the group was simply a Eurovision [[one-hit wonder]].\n\n====Post-Eurovision====\nIn November 1974, ABBA embarked on their first European tour, playing dates in Denmark, West Germany and Austria. It was not as successful as the band had hoped, since most of the venues did not sell out. Due to a lack of demand, they were even forced to cancel a few shows, including a sole concert scheduled in Switzerland. The second leg of the tour, which took them through Scandinavia in January 1975, was very different. They played to full houses everywhere and finally got the reception they had aimed for. Live performances continued in the middle of 1975 when ABBA embarked on a fourteen open-air date tour of Sweden and Finland. Their [[Stockholm]] show at the [[Gröna Lund]] amusement park had an estimated audience of 19,200.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=268}}</ref> Björn Ulvaeus later said that \"If you look at the singles we released straight after Waterloo, we were trying to be more like the [[The Sweet|Sweet]], a semi-glam rock group, which was stupid because we were always a pop group.\"<ref name=Guardian2014>{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/10/abba-interview-bjorn-ulvaeus-frida-lyngstad |title=Abba on Drugs, Eminem and Why Writing Great Pop is a Job for Young People|first= Tim|last= Jonze |work=The Guardian |date= 10 April 2014|accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1974, \"So Long\" was released as a single in the United Kingdom but it received no airplay from Radio 1 and failed to chart. In the middle of 1975, ABBA released \"[[I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do]]\", which again received little airplay on Radio 1 but managed to climb the charts, to number 38. Later that year, the release of their self-titled third studio album ''[[ABBA (album)|ABBA]]'' and single \"[[SOS (ABBA song)|SOS]]\" brought back their chart presence in the UK, where the single hit number six and the album peaked at number 13. \"SOS\" also became ABBA's second number-one single in Germany and their third in Australia. Success was further solidified with \"[[Mamma Mia (song)|Mamma Mia]]\" reaching number-one in the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia. In the United States, \"[[SOS (ABBA song)|SOS]]\" peaked at number 10 on the [[Record World]] Top 100 singles chart and number 15 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart, picking up the [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] Award along the way as one of the most played songs on American radio in 1975.\n\nThe success of the group in the United States had until that time been limited to single releases. By early 1976, the group already had four Top 30 singles on the US charts, but the album market proved to be tough to crack. The eponymous ''ABBA '' album generated three American hits, but it only peaked at number 165 on the ''Cashbox'' album chart and number 174 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart. Opinions were voiced, by ''Creem'' in particular, that in the US ABBA had endured \"a very sloppy promotional campaign\". Nevertheless, the group enjoyed warm reviews from the American press. ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' went as far as saying that \"there is a recurrent thread of taste and artistry inherent in Abba's marketing, creativity and presentation that makes it almost embarrassing to critique their efforts\", while ''Creem'' wrote: \"SOS is surrounded on this LP by so many good tunes that the mind boggles\".\n\nIn Australia, the airing of the music videos for \"I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do\" and \"Mamma Mia\" on the nationally broadcast TV pop show ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'' (which premiered in November 1974) saw the band rapidly gain enormous popularity, and ''Countdown'' become a key promoter of the group via their distinctive music videos. This started an immense interest for ABBA in Australia, resulting in both the single and album holding down the No. 1 positions on the charts for months.\n\n===1976–1981: Superstardom===\nIn March 1976, the band released the compilation album ''[[Greatest Hits (ABBA album)|Greatest Hits]]'', despite having had only six top 40 hits in the United Kingdom and the United States. Nevertheless, it became their first UK number-one album, and also took ABBA into the Top 50 on the US album charts for the first time, eventually selling more than a million copies there. At the same time, Germany released a compilation named ''The Very Best of ABBA'', also becoming a number-one album there whereas the ''Greatest Hits'' compilation followed a few months later to number-two on the German charts, despite all similarities with ''The Very Best'' album. Also included on ''Greatest Hits'' was a new single, \"[[Fernando (song)|Fernando]]\", which went to number-one in at least thirteen countries worldwide, including the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia, and the single went on to sell over 10&nbsp;million copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|author=Collins, Karen  |url=http://www.tagg.org/mmmsp/fernando.html |title=Fernando the Flute&nbsp;– Details |publisher=Tagg.org |date=25 August 2009 |accessdate=31 January 2010}}</ref> In Australia, the song occupied the top position for 14 weeks (and stayed in the chart for 40 weeks), tying with [[the Beatles]]' \"[[Hey Jude]]\" for longest-running number-one, and making \"Fernando\" one of the best-selling singles of all time in Australia. That same year, the group received its first international prize, with \"Fernando\" being chosen as the \"Best Studio Recording of 1975\". In the United States, \"Fernando\" reached the Top 10 of the Cashbox Top 100 singles chart and number 13 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. It also topped the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary]] chart, ABBA's first American number-one single on any chart.\n\n[[File:Frida Lyngstad and Benny Andersson 1976b.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Benny Andersson]] and [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]] in [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]], 1976|left]]\n\nThe group's fourth studio album, ''[[Arrival (ABBA album)|Arrival]]'', a number-one best-seller in Europe and Australia, represented a new level of accomplishment in both songwriting and studio work, prompting rave reviews from more rock-oriented UK music weeklies such as ''[[Melody Maker]]'' and ''[[NME|New Musical Express]]'', and mostly appreciative notices from US critics. Hit after hit flowed from ''Arrival'': \"[[Money, Money, Money]]\", another number-one in Germany and Australia, and \"[[Knowing Me, Knowing You]]\", ABBA's sixth consecutive German number-one as well as another UK number-one. The real sensation was \"[[Dancing Queen]]\", not only topping the charts in loyal markets the UK, Germany and Australia, but also reaching number-one in the United States. In South Africa, ABBA had astounding success with \"Fernando\", \"Dancing Queen\" and \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" being among the top 20 best-selling singles for 1976–77. In 1977, ''Arrival'' was nominated for the inaugural [[Brit Awards|BRIT Award]] in the category \"Best International Album of the Year\". By this time ABBA were popular in the United Kingdom, most of Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand. In ''Frida – The DVD'', Lyngstad explains how she and Fältskog developed as singers, as ABBA's recordings grew more complex over the years.\n\nThe band's popularity in the United States would remain on a comparatively smaller scale, and \"Dancing Queen\" became the only ''Billboard'' Hot 100 number-one single ABBA had there (they did, however, get three more singles to the number-one position on other ''Billboard'' charts, including ''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary and [[Hot Dance Club Play]]). Nevertheless, ''Arrival'' finally became a true breakthrough release for ABBA on the US album market where it peaked at number 20 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart and was certified gold by [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].\n\n====European and Australian tour====\nIn January 1977, ABBA embarked on their first major tour. The group's status had changed dramatically and they were clearly regarded as superstars. They opened their much anticipated tour in [[Oslo]], Norway, on 28 January, and mounted a lavishly produced spectacle that included a few scenes from their self-written mini-operetta ''The Girl with the Golden Hair''. The concert attracted immense media attention from across Europe and Australia. They continued the tour through Western Europe, visiting [[Gothenburg]], Copenhagen, Berlin, [[Cologne]], Amsterdam, [[Antwerp]], [[Essen]], [[Hanover]], and [[Hamburg]] and ending with shows in the United Kingdom in [[Manchester]], Birmingham, Glasgow and two sold-out concerts at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]]. Tickets for these two shows were available only by mail application and it was later revealed that the box-office received 3.5&nbsp;million requests for tickets, enough to fill the venue 580 times. Along with praise (\"ABBA turn out to be amazingly successful at reproducing their records\", wrote ''[[Creem]]''), there were complaints that \"ABBA performed slickly...but with a zero personality coming across from a total of 16 people on stage\" (''[[Melody Maker]]''). One of the Royal Albert Hall concerts was filmed as a reference for the filming of the Australian tour for what became ''[[ABBA: The Movie]]'', though it is not exactly known how much of the concert was filmed.\n\n[[File:Abba 28011977 15 200.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[Agnetha Fältskog]] at the opening concert of ABBA's European and Australian Tour in [[Oslo]], 28 January 1977]]\nAfter the European leg of the tour, in March 1977, ABBA played 11 dates in Australia before a total of 160,000 people. The opening concert in Sydney at the [[Sydney Showground (Moore Park)|Sydney Showground]] on 3 March to an audience of 20,000 was marred by torrential rain with Lyngstad slipping on the wet stage during the concert. However, all four members would later recall this concert as the most memorable of their career. Upon their arrival in [[Melbourne]], a civic reception was held at the [[Melbourne Town Hall]] and ABBA appeared on the balcony to greet an enthusiastic crowd of 6,000. In Melbourne, the group played three concerts at the [[Sidney Myer Music Bowl]] with 14,500 at each including the Australian Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]] and his family. At the first Melbourne concert, an additional 16,000 people gathered outside the fenced-off area to listen to the concert. In [[Adelaide]], the group performed one concert at [[Football Park|West Lakes Football Stadium]] in front of 20,000 people, with another 10,000 listening outside. During the first of five concerts in Perth, there was a bomb scare with everyone having to evacuate the [[Perth Entertainment Centre|Entertainment Centre]]. The trip was accompanied by mass hysteria and unprecedented media attention (\"Swedish ABBA stirs box-office in Down Under tour...and the media coverage of the quartet rivals that set to cover the upcoming Royal tour of Australia\", wrote ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''), and is captured on film in ''[[ABBA: The Movie]]'', directed by [[Lasse Hallström]].\n\nThe Australian tour and its subsequent ''ABBA: The Movie'' produced some ABBA lore, as well. Fältskog's blonde good looks had long made her the band's \"pin-up girl\", a role she disdained. During the Australian tour, she performed in a skin-tight white jumpsuit, causing one Australian newspaper to use the headline \"Agnetha's bottom tops dull show\". When asked about this at a news conference, she replied: \"Don't they have bottoms in Australia?\"<ref>DVD documentaries: ''The Winner Takes It All'' (2002) and ''Super Troupers'' (2004)</ref>\n\nIn December 1977, ABBA followed up ''Arrival'' with the more ambitious fifth album ''[[ABBA: The Album]]'', released to coincide with the debut of ''ABBA: The Movie''. Although the album was less well received by UK reviewers, it did spawn more worldwide hits: \"[[The Name of the Game (ABBA song)|The Name of the Game]]\" and \"[[Take a Chance on Me]]\", which both topped the UK charts, and peaked at number 12 and number three, respectively, on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart in the US. Although \"Take a Chance on Me\" did not top the American charts, it proved to be ABBA's biggest hit single there, selling more copies than \"Dancing Queen\".<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=382}}</ref> ''The Album'' also included \"[[Thank You for the Music]]\", the B-side of \"[[Eagle (song)|Eagle]]\" in countries where the latter had been released as a single, and was belatedly released as an A-side single in the United Kingdom and Ireland in 1983. \"[[Thank You for the Music]]\" has become one of the best loved and best known ABBA songs without being released as a single during the group's lifetime.\n\n====Polar Music Studio formation====\n[[File:Sportpalatset Stockholm 2010.jpg|thumb|Polar Music Studios was situated in this building at 58 Sankt Eriksgatan in Stockholm until 2004]]\n\nBy 1978 ABBA were one of the biggest bands in the world. They converted a vacant cinema into the [[Polar Music]] Studio, a state-of-the-art studio in [[Stockholm]]. The studio was used by several other bands; notably [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]]' ''[[Duke (album)|Duke]]'' and [[Led Zeppelin]]'s ''[[In Through the Out Door]]'' were recorded there. During May, the group went to the United States for a promotional campaign, performing alongside [[Andy Gibb]] on [[Olivia Newton-John]]'s TV show. Recording sessions for the single \"[[Summer Night City]]\" were an uphill struggle,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} but upon release the song became another hit for the group. The track would set the stage for ABBA's foray into [[disco]] with their next album.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=383–386}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 January 1979, the group performed \"[[Chiquitita]]\" at the [[Music for UNICEF Concert]] held at the [[United Nations General Assembly]] to celebrate UNICEF's Year of the Child. ABBA donated the [[copyright]] of this worldwide hit to the [[United Nations Children's Fund|UNICEF]]; see [[Music for UNICEF Concert]].<ref>\"Bee Gees, Olivia were a hit with the VIPs\" (11 January 1979). ''Courier Mail'' (Brisbane); p. 30.</ref> The single was released the following week, and reached number-one in ten countries.\n\n====North American and European tours====\n[[File:ABBA Edmonton 1979 001.jpg|thumb|left|ABBA at Edmonton, Canada, 1979]]\nIn mid-January 1979, Ulvaeus and Fältskog announced they were getting divorced. The news caused interest from the media and led to speculation about the band's future. ABBA assured the press and their fan base they were continuing their work as a group and that the divorce would not affect them.<ref>\"ABBA divorce&nbsp;– Agnetha moves out\" (17 January 1979). ''The Sun'' (Sydney); p.&nbsp;1.</ref> Nonetheless, the media continued to confront them with this in interviews. To escape the media swirl and concentrate on their writing, Andersson and Ulvaeus secretly travelled to [[Compass Point Studios]] in [[Nassau, Bahamas]], where for two weeks they prepared their next album's songs.\n\nThe group's sixth studio album, ''[[Voulez-Vous]]'', was released in April 1979, the title track of which was recorded at the famous [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami, Florida, with the assistance of recording engineer [[Tom Dowd]] amongst others. The album topped the charts across Europe and in Japan and Mexico, hit the Top 10 in Canada and Australia and the Top 20 in the United States. None of the singles from the album reached number-one on the UK charts, but \"[[Chiquitita]]\", \"[[Does Your Mother Know]]\", \"[[Angeleyes]]\" (with \"[[Voulez-Vous (song)|Voulez-Vous]]\", released as a double A-side) and \"[[I Have a Dream (song)|I Have a Dream]]\" were all UK Top 5 hits. In Canada, \"I Have a Dream\" became ABBA's second number-one on the [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]] Adult Contemporary chart (after \"Fernando\" hit the top previously). Also in 1979, the group released their second compilation album, ''[[Greatest Hits Vol. 2 (ABBA album)|Greatest Hits Vol. 2]]'', which featured a brand new track: \"[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]\", another number-three hit in both the UK and Germany. In Russia during the late 1970s, the group was paid in oil commodities because of an [[embargo]] on the [[Soviet ruble|ruble]].<ref>Rodgers, Peter (16 March 1980). \"Pop Goes ABBA's $2m Oil Gamble: ABBA May Lose Enormous Amount of Money Following Venture into Oil Market. \" ''The Sunday Times''; Business News, p&nbsp;53</ref>\n\nOn 13 September 1979, ABBA began [[ABBA: The Tour]] at [[Northlands Coliseum]] in Edmonton, Canada, with a full house of 14,000. \"The voices of the band, Agnetha's high sauciness combined with round, rich lower tones of Anni-Frid, were excellent...Technically perfect, melodically correct and always in perfect pitch...The soft lower voice of Anni-Frid and the high, edgy vocals of Agnetha were stunning\", raved ''[[Edmonton Journal]]''.\n\nDuring the next four weeks they played a total of 17 sold-out dates, 13 in the United States and four in Canada. The last scheduled ABBA concert in the United States in Washington, D.C. was cancelled due to Fältskog's emotional distress suffered during the flight from New York to Boston, when the group's private plane was subjected to [[Windsor Locks, Connecticut Tornado|extreme weather conditions]] and was unable to land for an extended period. They appeared at the [[Citi Performing Arts Center|Boston Music Hall]] for the performance 90 minutes late. The tour ended with a show in Toronto, Canada at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] before a capacity crowd of 18,000. \"ABBA plays with surprising power and volume; but although they are loud, they're also clear, which does justice to the signature vocal sound...Anyone who's been waiting five years to see Abba will be well satisfied\", wrote ''[[Record World]]''.\n\nOn 19 October 1979, the tour resumed in Western Europe where the band played 23 sold-out gigs, including six sold-out nights at London's [[Wembley Arena]].\n\n====Progression====\n[[File:ABBA - Super Trouper (Polar).jpg|thumbnail|''[[Super Trouper (album)|Super Trouper]]'', seventh studio album released by the group in 1980]]\nIn March 1980, ABBA travelled to Japan where upon their arrival at [[Narita International Airport]], they were besieged by thousands of fans. The group played eleven concerts to full houses, including six shows at Tokyo's [[Nippon Budokan|Budokan]]. This tour was the last \"on the road\" adventure of their career.\nIn the middle of 1980, the group released the single \"[[The Winner Takes It All]]\" the group's eighth UK chart topper (and their first since 1978). The song is widely misunderstood as being written about Ulvaeus and Fältskog's marital tribulations; Ulvaeus wrote the lyrics, but has stated they were not about his own divorce; Fältskog has repeatedly stated she was not the loser in their divorce. In the United States, the single peaked at number-eight on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart and became ABBA's second ''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary number-one. It was also re-recorded by Andersson and Ulvaeus with a slightly different backing track, by French chanteuse [[Mireille Mathieu]] at the end of 1980&nbsp;– as \"Bravo Tu As Gagné\", with French lyrics by Alain Boublil. November the same year saw the release of ABBA's seventh album ''[[Super Trouper (album)|Super Trouper]]'', which reflected a certain change in ABBA's style with more prominent use of synthesizers and increasingly personal lyrics. It set a record for the most pre-orders ever received for a UK album after one million copies were ordered before release.  The second single from the album, \"[[Super Trouper (song)|Super Trouper]]\", also hit number-one in the UK, becoming the group's ninth and final UK chart-topper. Another track from the ''Super Trouper'' album, \"[[Lay All Your Love on Me]]\", released in 1981 as a {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} single only in selected territories, managed to top the ''Billboard'' Hot Dance Club Play chart and peaked at number-seven on the UK singles chart becoming, at the time, the highest ever charting {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} release in UK chart history.\n\nAlso in 1980, ABBA recorded a compilation of Spanish-language versions of their hits called ''[[Gracias Por La Música (album)|Gracias Por La Música]]''. This was released in Spanish-speaking countries as well as in Japan and Australia. The album became a major success, and along with the Spanish version of \"Chiquitita\", this signalled the group's breakthrough in Latin America. ''ABBA Oro: Grandes Éxitos'', the Spanish equivalent of ''ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits'', was released in 1999.\n\n===1981–1982: Final album and performances===\n[[File:ABBA Last Interveiw - Cavett.png|thumb| left|ABBA during a TV special ''[[Dick Cavett Meets ABBA]]'' in April 1981]]\n\nIn January 1981, Ulvaeus married Lena Källersjö, and manager Stig Anderson celebrated his 50th birthday with a party. For this occasion, ABBA recorded the track \"Hovas Vittne\" (a pun on the Swedish name for [[Jehovah's Witness]] and Anderson's birthplace, [[Hova, Sweden|Hova]]) as a tribute to him, and released it only on 200 red vinyl copies, to be distributed to the guests attending the party. This single has become a sought-after collectible. In mid-February 1981, Andersson and Lyngstad announced they were filing for divorce. Information surfaced that their marriage had been an uphill struggle for years, and Benny had already met another woman, Mona Nörklit, whom he married in November 1981.\n\nAndersson and Ulvaeus had songwriting sessions in early 1981, and recording sessions began in mid-March. At the end of April, the group recorded a TV special, ''[[Dick Cavett Meets ABBA]]'' with the US talk show host [[Dick Cavett]]. ''[[The Visitors (ABBA album)|The Visitors]]'', ABBA's eighth and final studio album, showed a songwriting maturity and depth of feeling distinctly lacking from their earlier recordings but still placing the band squarely in the pop genre, with catchy tunes and harmonies. Although not revealed at the time of its release, the album's title track, according to Ulvaeus, refers to the secret meetings held against the approval of totalitarian governments in Soviet-dominated states, while other tracks address topics like failed relationships, the threat of war, ageing, and loss of innocence. The album's only major single release, \"[[One of Us (ABBA song)|One of Us]]\", proved to be the last of ABBA's nine number-one singles in Germany, this being in December 1981; and the swansong of their sixteen Top 5 singles on the South African chart. \"One of Us\" was also ABBA's final Top 3 hit in the UK, reaching No. 1 on some charts (such as Record Mirror).\n\nAlthough it topped the album charts across most of Europe, including Ireland, the UK and Germany, ''The Visitors'' was not as commercially successful as its predecessors, showing a commercial decline in previously loyal markets such as France, Australia and Japan. A track from the album, \"[[When All Is Said and Done (song)|When All Is Said and Done]]\", was released as a single in North America, Australia and New Zealand, and fittingly became ABBA's final Top 40 hit in the US (debuting on the US charts on 31 December 1981), while also reaching the US Adult Contemporary Top 10, and number-four on the RPM Adult Contemporary chart in Canada. The song's lyrics, as with \"[[The Winner Takes It All]]\" and \"One of Us\", dealt with the painful experience of separating from a long-term partner, though it looked at the trauma more optimistically. With the now publicised story of Andersson and Lyngstad's divorce, speculation increased of tension within the band. Also released in the United States was the title track of ''The Visitors'', which hit the Top Ten on the ''Billboard'' Hot Dance Club Play chart.\n\n====Final recording sessions====\nIn the spring of 1982, songwriting sessions had started and the group came together for more recordings. Plans were not completely clear, but a new album was discussed and the prospect of a small tour suggested. The recording sessions in May and June 1982 were a struggle, and only three songs were eventually recorded: \"You Owe Me One\", \"I Am the City\" and \"Just Like That\". Andersson and Ulvaeus were not satisfied with the outcome, so the tapes were shelved and the group took a break for the summer.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=455–56}}</ref>\n\nBack in the studio again in early August, the group had changed plans for the rest of the year: they settled for a Christmas release of a double album compilation of all their past single releases to be named ''[[The Singles: The First Ten Years]]''. New songwriting and recording sessions took place,<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|pp=456–57}}</ref> and during October and December, they released the singles \"[[The Day Before You Came]]\"/\"[[Cassandra (ABBA song)|Cassandra]]\" and \"[[Under Attack]]\"/\"[[You Owe Me One]]\", the A-sides of which were included on the compilation album. Neither single made the Top 20 in the United Kingdom, though \"[[The Day Before You Came]]\" became a Top 5 hit in many European countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. The album went to number-one in the UK and Belgium, Top 5 in the Netherlands and Germany and Top 20 in many other countries. \"Under Attack\", the group's final release before disbanding, was a Top 5 hit in the Netherlands and Belgium.\n\n\"I Am the City\" and \"Just Like That\" were left unreleased on ''The Singles: The First Ten Years'' for possible inclusion on the next projected studio album, though this never came to fruition. \"I Am the City\" was eventually released on the compilation album ''[[More Gold: More Hits|More ABBA Gold]]'' in 1993, while \"Just Like That\" has been recycled in new songs with other artists produced by Andersson and Ulvaeus. A reworked version of the verses ended up in the musical ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=490}}</ref> The chorus section of \"Just Like That\" was eventually released on a retrospective box set in 1994, as well as in the ''ABBA Undeleted'' medley featured on disc 9 of ''The Complete Studio Recordings''. Despite a number of requests from fans, Ulvaeus and Andersson are still refusing to release ABBA's version of \"Just Like That\" in its entirety, even though the complete version surfaced on bootlegs.\n\nThe group travelled to London to promote ''The Singles: The First Ten Years'' in the first week of November 1982, appearing on ''[[Saturday Superstore]]'' and ''[[The Late, Late Breakfast Show]]'', and also to West Germany in the second week, to perform on Show Express. On 19 November 1982, ABBA appeared for the last time in Sweden on the TV programme Nöjesmaskinen, and on 11 December 1982, they made their last performance ever, transmitted to the UK on [[Noel Edmonds]]' ''[[The Late, Late Breakfast Show]]'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://home.bt.com/news/showbiz-news/abba-together-on-stage-again-but-only-to-open-a-taverna-11364034663670|title=ABBA together on stage again – but only to open a taverna |first=Michael|last=Moran | publisher=Bt.com|date=21 January 2016| access-date=22 July 2016}}</ref> through a live link from a TV studio in [[Stockholm]].\n\n====Final performances====\nAndersson and Ulvaeus began collaborating with [[Tim Rice]] in early 1983 on writing songs for the musical project ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'', while Fältskog and Lyngstad both concentrated on international solo careers. While Andersson and Ulvaeus were working on the musical, a further co-operation among the three of them came with the musical ''[[Abbacadabra]]'' that was produced in France for television. It was a children's musical utilising 14&nbsp;ABBA songs. [[Alain Boublil|Alain]] and Daniel Boublil, who wrote ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'', had been in touch with Stig Anderson about the project, and the TV musical was aired over Christmas on French TV and later a Dutch version was also broadcast. Boublil previously also wrote the French lyric for Mireille Mathieu's version of \"The Winner Takes It All\".\n\nAnni-Frid Lyngstad, who had recently moved to Paris, participated in the French version, and recorded a single, \"Belle\", a duet with French singer [[Daniel Balavoine]]. The song was a cover of ABBA's 1976 instrumental track \"[[Arrival (song)|Arrival]]\". As the single \"Belle\" sold well in France, [[Cameron Mackintosh]] wanted to stage an English-language version of the show in London, with the French lyrics translated by [[David Wood (actor)|David Wood]] and [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]]; Andersson and Ulvaeus got involved in the project, and contributed with one new song, \"I Am the Seeker\". \"Abbacadabra\" premiered on 8 December 1983 at the Lyric Hammersmith Theatre in London, to mixed reviews and full houses for eight weeks, closing on 21 January 1984. Lyngstad was also involved in this production, recording \"Belle\" in English as \"Time\", a duet with actor and singer [[B. A. Robertson]]: the single sold well, and was produced and recorded by Mike Batt. A year later, Lyngstad performed \"I Have A Dream\" with a children's choir at the United Nations Organisation Gala, in May 1984 at Geneva, Switzerland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abbaontv.com/1984/description-unicef.html|title=Gala de l'ONU (Organisation des Nations Unis) - United Nations Organisation Gala part 1|accessdate=11 October 2017|publisher=ABBAONTV}}</ref>\n\nAll four members made their (at the time, their final) public appearance as four friends more than as ABBA in January 1986, when they recorded a video of themselves performing an acoustic version of \"Tivedshambo\" (which was the first song written by their manager Stig Anderson), for a Swedish TV show honouring Anderson on his 55th birthday. The four had not seen each other for more than two years. That same year they also performed privately at another friend's 40th birthday: their old tour manager, [[Claes af Geijerstam]]. They sang a self-written song titled \"Der Kleine Franz\" that was later to resurface in ''Chess''. Also in 1986, ''[[ABBA Live]]'' was released, featuring selections of live performances from the group's 1977 and 1979 tours. The four members were guests at the 50th birthday of Görel Hanser in 1999. Hanser was a long-time friend of all four, and also former secretary of Stig Anderson. Honouring Görel, ABBA performed a Swedish birthday song \"Med En Enkel Tulipan\" [[a cappella]].<ref>[http://www.raffem.com/BjornUlvaeusBiogr.htm Björn Ulvaeus]. raffem.com – ABBA's last known appearance (1999)</ref>\n\nBenny Andersson has on several occasions performed old ABBA songs. In June 1992, he and Ulvaeus appeared with [[U2]] at a Stockholm concert, singing the chorus of \"[[Dancing Queen]]\", and a few years later during the final performance of the B & B in Concert in Stockholm, Andersson joined the cast for an encore at the piano. Andersson frequently adds an ABBA song to the playlist when he performs with his [[Benny Anderssons Orkester|BAO]] band. He also played the piano during new recordings of the ABBA songs \"Like an Angel Passing Through My Room\" with opera singer [[Anne Sofie von Otter]], and \"When All Is Said and Done\" with Swede [[Viktoria Tolstoy]]. In 2002, Andersson and Ulvaeus both performed an a cappella rendition of the first verse of \"Fernando\" as they accepted their Ivor Novello award in London. Lyngstad performed and recorded an a cappella version of \"Dancing Queen\" with the Swedish group [[the Real Group]] in 1993, and also re-recorded \"I Have a Dream\" with Swiss singer Dan Daniell in 2003.\n\n====Permanent break====\nABBA has never officially announced the end of the group, but it has long been considered dissolved. Their final public performance together as ABBA was on the British TV programme ''[[The Late, Late Breakfast Show]]'' (live from Stockholm) on 11 December 1982. While reminiscing on \"[[The Day Before You Came]]\", Ulvaeus said: \"we might have continued for a while longer if that had been a number one\".<ref>{{cite news | work=YouTube.com| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBG4H6M8alw | title=ABBA The History 1999 Documentary}}</ref> In January 1983, Fältskog started recording sessions for a solo album, as Lyngstad had successfully released her album ''[[Something's Going On]]'' some months earlier. Ulvaeus and Andersson, meanwhile, started songwriting sessions for the musical ''Chess''. In interviews at the time, Björn and Benny denied the split of ABBA (\"Who are we without our ladies? Initials of [[Brigitte Bardot]]?\"), and Lyngstad and Fältskog kept claiming in interviews that ABBA would come together for a new album repeatedly during 1983 and 1984. Internal strife between the group and their manager escalated and the band members sold their shares in [[Polar Music]] during 1983. Except for a TV appearance in 1986, the foursome did not come together publicly again until they were reunited at the Swedish premiere of the ''[[Mamma Mia! (film)|Mamma Mia!]]'' movie on 4 July 2008.\n\nIn an interview with the ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'', following the premiere, Ulvaeus and Andersson confirmed that there was nothing that could entice them back on stage again. Ulvaeus said: \"We will never appear on stage again. [...] There is simply no motivation to re-group. Money is not a factor and we would like people to remember us as we were. Young, exuberant, full of energy and ambition. I remember [[Robert Plant]] saying [[Led Zeppelin]] were a [[cover band]] now because they cover all their own stuff. I think that hit the nail on the head.\"<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/07/05/bmabba105.xml | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=ABBA's Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson: We Will Never Reform | first=Chris | last=Hastings | date=5 July 2008}}</ref>\nHowever, on 3 January 2011, Fältskog, who has been long considered to be the most reclusive member of the group and a major obstacle to any reunion, raised the possibility of reuniting for a one-off engagement. She admitted that she has not yet brought the idea up to the other three members. In April 2013, she reiterated her hopes for reunion during an interview with ''[[Die Zeit]]'', stating: \"If they ask me, I'll say yes.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/musikk/artikkel.php?artid=10102871 |title=Agnetha åpner for ABBA-gjenforening – VG Nett |publisher=Vg.no |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=18 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn a May 2013 interview, Fältskog, aged 63 at the time, confirmed that an ABBA reunion will never occur: \"I think we have to accept that it will not happen, because we are too old and each one of us has their own life. Too many years have gone by since we stopped, and there's really no meaning in putting us together again.\" Fältskog further explained that the band members remained on amicable terms: \"It's always nice to see each other now and then and to talk a little and to be a little nostalgic.\"<ref name=\"Dave\" /> In an April 2014 interview, Fältskog, when asked about whether the band might reunite for a new recording said: \"It's difficult to talk about this because then all the news stories will be: 'ABBA is going to record another song!'

I would love to, but it's up to Björn and Benny.\"<ref name=Guardian2014/>\n\n===2016–present: Reunion and upcoming hologram project===\n\nOn 20 January 2016, all four original members of ABBA made a public appearance at ''Mamma Mia the Party'' in Stockholm.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/abba-have-finally-reunited-in-sweden-for-the-opening-of-a-mamma-miathemed-restaurant/news-story/4abab91390a7c78bb93aacf26d659808 ABBA pictured together for first time in 34 years], ABBA have finally reunited in Sweden, for the opening of a Mamma Mia-themed restaurant, 2016-01-21, Cameron Adams, News Corp Australia Network</ref>\n\nOn 6 June 2016, the four members of ABBA appeared together at a private party at [[Berns Salonger]] in Stockholm, which was held to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Andersson and Ulvaeus' first meeting.

The singles \"[[One Night in Bangkok]]\" (with vocals by [[Murray Head]] and [[Anders Glenmark]] ) and \"[[I Know Him So Well]]\" (a duet by [[Barbara Dickson]] and [[Elaine Paige]], and later also recorded by both [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Whitney Houston]]) were both hugely successful. The former reached number-one in Australia, Germany, Spain and Switzerland; number-two in Austria, France and New Zealand; number-three in Canada, Norway, Sweden and the US, as well as reaching the top 10 in a few other countries. In May 1986, the musical premiered in London's West End, and ran for almost three years. ''Chess'' also opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in April 1988, but closed within two months due to bad reviews. In Stockholm, the composers staged ''Chess på svenska'' (''Chess in Swedish'') in 2003, with some new material, including the musical numbers ''\"Han är en man, han är ett barn\"'' (\"He's a Man, He's a Child\") and ''\"Glöm mig om du kan\"'' (\"Forget Me If You Can\"). In 2008, the musical was again revived for a successful staging at London's Royal Albert Hall which was subsequently released on DVD, and then in two successful separate touring productions in the United States and United Kingdom, in 2010.\n\n[[File:Benny Andersson ABBA.jpg|thumb|Benny Andersson during a performance in [[Minnesota]], 2006]]\n\nAndersson and Ulvaeus' next project, ''[[Kristina från Duvemåla]]'', an epic Swedish musical, premiered in [[Malmö]], in southern Sweden in October 1995. The musical ran for five years in Stockholm, and an English version has been in development for some considerable time. It has been reported that a Broadway production is in its earliest stages of pre-production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icethesite.com/content/kristina.aspx |title=Kristina från Duvemåla&nbsp;– The Musical |publisher=icethesite |accessdate=23 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100801093057/http://icethesite.com/content/kristina.aspx| archivedate= 1 August 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> In the meantime, following some earlier workshops, a full presentation of the English translation of the musical in concert, now with the shortened name of ''\"Kristina\"'', took place to capacity crowds in September 2009 at New York's Carnegie Hall, and in April 2010 at London's Royal Albert Hall, followed by a CD release of the New York recordings.\n\nSince 1983, besides ''Chess'' and ''Kristina från Duvemåla'', Benny Andersson has continued writing songs with Ulvaeus. The pair produced two English-language pop albums with Swedish duo [[Gemini (Swedish band)|Gemini]] in 1985 and 1987. In 1987, Andersson also released his first solo album on his own label, Mono Music, called \"''[[Klinga mina klockor]]''\" (\"Ring My Bells\"), all new material inspired by Swedish folk music&nbsp;– and followed it with his second album titled ''[[November 1989 (album)|November 1989]]''.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Andersson wrote music for the popular Swedish cabaret quartet [[Ainbusk|Ainbusk Singers]], giving them two hits: \"Lassie\" and \"''Älska mig''\" (\"Love me\"), and later produced ''[[Shapes (album)|Shapes]]'', an English-language album by group's [[Josefin Nilsson]] with all-new material by Andersson and Ulvaeus. Andersson has also regularly written music for films (most notably to [[Roy Andersson]]'s ''[[Songs from the Second Floor]]''). In 2001, Andersson formed his own band, [[Benny Anderssons Orkester]] (BAO), which released three successful albums in 2001, 2004 and 2007. Andersson has the distinction of remaining the longest in the Swedish Radio [[Svensktoppen]] charts; the song ''\"Du är min man\"'' (\"You Are My Man\"), sung by [[Helen Sjöholm]], spent 278 weeks there between 2004 and 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sverigesradio.se/cgi-bin/p4/programsidor/artikel.asp?ProgramID=2023&Artikel=454872|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815042720/http://sverigesradio.se/cgi-bin/p4/programsidor/artikel.asp?ProgramID=2023&Artikel=454872|archivedate=15 August 2007|date=2 July 2006|title=Aktuell lista |publisher=sr.se |accessdate=31 January 2010}}</ref> Andersson released his third album [[BAO 3]] in October 2007, of new material with his band BAO and vocalists Helen Sjöholm and [[Tommy Körberg]], as well as playing to full houses at two of Sweden's largest concert venues in October and November 2007, with an audience of 14,000.\n\n[[File:2015-12-12-030 Björn Ulvaeus (29193749840) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Björn Ulvaeus lecturing in Stockholm, 2015]] Ulvaeus has not appeared on stage performing music since ABBA, but had a reunion with his co-members of the Hootenanny Singers on 16 July 2005 at a music festival in his hometown of [[Västervik]], singing their 1966 hit \"Marianne\".\n\nAndersson and Ulvaeus have been highly involved in the worldwide productions of the musical ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'', alongside Lyngstad who attends premieres. They were also involved in the production of the successful film version of the musical, which opened in July 2008. Andersson produced the soundtrack utilising many of the musicians ABBA used on their albums and tours. Andersson made a cameo appearance in the movie as a 'fisherman' piano player in the \"Dancing Queen\" scene, while Ulvaeus is seen as a Greek god playing a [[lyre]] during the closing credits.\n\nAndersson and Ulvaeus have continuously been writing new material; most recently the two wrote 7 songs for Anderssons 'BAO' 2011 album 'O Klang Och Jubeltid', performed as usual by vocalists Sjöholm, Körberg and Moreus. In July 2009, 'BAO' released their first international release, now named the Benny Andersson Band, with the album ''The Story of a Heart''. The album was a compilation of 14 tracks from Andersson's five Swedish-language releases between 1987 and 2007, including five songs now recorded with lyrics by Ulvaeus in English, and the new title song premiered on BBC2's ''Ken Bruce Show''. A Swedish-language version of the title track, ''\"Sommaren Du Fick\"'' (\"The Summer You Got\"), was released as a single in Sweden prior to the English version, with vocals by Helen Sjöholm. In May 2009, Andersson also released a single recorded by the staff at his privately owned [[Stockholm]] hotel ''Hotel Rival'', titled \"[[2nd Best to None]]\", accompanied by a video showing the staff at work. In 2008, Andersson and Ulvaeus wrote a song for Swedish singer [[Sissela Kyle]], titled ''\"Jag vill bli gammal\"'' (\"I Wanna Grow Old\"), for her Stockholm stage show ''\"Your Days Are Numbered\"'', which was never recorded and released, but did get a TV performance. Ulvaeus also contributed lyrics to ABBA's 1976 instrumental track \"Arrival\" for [[Sarah Brightman]]'s cover version recorded for her 2008 album ''[[Winter Symphony]]''. New English lyrics have also been written for Andersson's 1999 song ''\"Innan Gryningen\"'' (then also named \"Millennium Hymn\"), with the new title \"The Silence of the Dawn\" for [[Barbara Dickson]] (performed live, but not yet recorded and released). In 2007, they wrote the new song ''\"Han som har vunnit allt\"'' (\"He Who's Won It All\") for actor/singer [[Anders Ekborg]]. Björn wrote English lyrics for two older songs from Benny's solo albums: \"I Walk with You Mama\" (\"Stockholm by Night\", 1989) and \"After the Rain\" (\"Efter regnet\", 1987) for opera singer [[Anne Sofie von Otter]], for her Andersson tribute album ''I Let the Music Speak''. [[Barbara Dickson]] recorded (but not yet released) a Björn & Benny song called \"The Day The Wall Came Tumbling Down\"; the song eventually was released by Australian 'Mamma Mia!' musical star [[Anne Wood]] 201 album of ABBA covers, [[Divine Discontent]]. As of October 2012, Björn Ulvaeus has mentioned writing new material with Benny for a 'BAO' Christmas release (also mentioned as a BAO 'box'), and Benny is busy writing music for a Swedish language obscure musical, 'Hjälp Sökes' ('Help is Wanted') together with Kristina Lugn and Lars Rudolfsson, premiering 8 February 2013. Andersson has also written music for a documentary film about [[Olof Palme]], re-recording the track 'Sorgmarch' from his last album throughout the film.\n\n====Agnetha Fältskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad====\n{{Main article|1=Agnetha Fältskog|2=Anni-Frid Lyngstad}}\n[[File:Anni Frid Lyngstad on The Story of ABBA 1982.jpg|thumb|Lyngstad in 1982]]\nBoth female members of ABBA pursued solo careers on the international scene after their work with the group. In 1982, Lyngstad chose [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] drummer and vocalist [[Phil Collins]] to produce the album ''[[Something's Going On]]'' and unveiled the hit single and video \"[[I Know There's Something Going On]]\" in August of that year. The single became a number-one hit in France (where it spent five weeks at the top), Belgium, Switzerland and Costa Rica. The track reached number-three in Austria, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Poland, and was also a Top 10 hit in Germany, Italy, Finland, South Africa and Australia. The track also proved successful in the USA, peaking at No. 13 (and spending almost four months on the Billboard Hot 100). [[Sveriges Television]] documented this historical event, by filming the whole recording process. The result became a one-hour TV documentary, including interviews with Lyngstad, Collins, Ulvaeus and Andersson as well as all the musicians. This documentary and the promotion videos from the album are included in ''[[Frida – The DVD]]''.\n\nLyngstad's second solo album after ABBA was called ''[[Shine (Frida album)|Shine]]'', produced by [[Steve Lillywhite]]. ''Shine'' was recorded in Paris and released in 1984. ''Shine'' was Lyngstad's final studio album release for twelve years. It featured \"Slowly\", the last known Andersson-Ulvaeus composition to have been recorded by one of the former female ABBA vocalists to date. The promotion videos and clips for \"Shine\" are included in ''Frida – The DVD''.\n\nIn 1980, Agnetha Fältskog and her 7-year-old daughter Linda recorded ''Nu tändas tusen juleljus'', a Swedish Christmas album. Released in 1981, it was Fältskog's first Swedish-language recording for the Polar Music label after she left CBS-Cupol. It peaked at No. 6 on the Swedish album chart in January 1982, has been re-released on CD by Polar Music/PolyGram/Universal Music in the 1990s and 2000s, and is one of the best-selling Swedish Christmas albums of all time.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The album title is derived from one of Scandinavia's best-known Christmas carols, \"[[Nu tändas tusen juleljus]]\" (Now a thousand Christmas candles are lit).\n\nIn 1983, Fältskog released the solo album ''[[Wrap Your Arms Around Me]]'' which achieved platinum sales in Sweden. This included the single \"The Heat Is On\", which was a hit all over Europe and Scandinavia. It reached number-one in Sweden and Norway and number-two in the Netherlands and Belgium. In the United States, Fältskog earned a ''Billboard'' Top 30 hit with \"Can't Shake Loose\". The single \"Wrap Your Arms Around Me\" was another successful hit, topping the charts in Belgium and Denmark, reaching the Top 5 in Sweden, the Netherlands and South Africa, and the Top 20 in Germany and France. The album sold 1.2 million copies worldwide.<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=470}}</ref> The album was produced by the highly successful producer and songwriter Mike Chapman, also known for his work with the Sweet, Mud, Suzi Quatro, Blondie, Pat Benatar and the Knack.\n[[File:Agnetha Fältskog on The Story of ABBA 1982.jpg|thumb|left|Fältskog in 1982]]\n\"It's So Nice to be Rich\" was Agnetha's fourth top ten hit in Sweden in 1983. Her duet with Tomas Ledin, \"Never Again\", was the first.\n\nFältskog's second English-language solo album, ''[[Eyes of a Woman]]'', was released in March 1985. It peaked at number two in Sweden (becoming a platinum seller), and performing reasonably well in Europe. The album was produced by [[Eric Stewart]] of [[10cc]]. The first single from the album was her self-penned \"I Won't Let You Go\". Agnetha's duet with Ola Håkansson, \"The Way You Are\", was a number-one hit in Sweden in 1986 and was awarded double platinum status.\n\nIn early 1987, Agnetha recorded an album \"Kom följ med I vår karusell\" ('Come ride with me on my carousel') with her son Christian. The album contained songs for children and was sung in Swedish. For the album Agnetha recorded duets with her son and with a choir of children. She also recorded a few solo songs. The single 'Pa Sondag' was much played at the radio and even made the Swedish top 10, unique for a song made for kids to enjoy.\n\nAlso in 1987, Fältskog released her third post-ABBA solo album, the [[Peter Cetera]]-produced ''[[I Stand Alone (Agnetha Fältskog album)|I Stand Alone]]'', which also included the ''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary duet with Cetera, \"[[I Wasn't the One (Who Said Goodbye)]]\", as well as the European charting singles \"The Last Time\" and \"Let It Shine\". The album was extremely successful in Sweden, where it spent eight weeks at number-one and was awarded double-platinum. Shortly after some minor European promotion for the album in early 1988, Fältskog withdrew from public life and halted her music career. In 1996, she released her autobiography, ''As I Am'', and a compilation album featuring her solo hits alongside some ABBA classics.\n\nIn 2004, she made a successful comeback, when she released the critically acclaimed album ''[[My Colouring Book]]'' containing 1960s covers who had the most impact on her teenage years as a music contender. It debuted at number-one in Sweden (achieving triple-platinum status), number-six in Germany, and number 12 in the UK, winning a silver award, and achieving gold status in Finland. The single \"[[If I Thought You'd Ever Change Your Mind]]\" (a cover of the Cilla Black 1960s song) became Fältskog's biggest solo hit in the United Kingdom, reaching number 11. The single peaked at number-two in Sweden and was a hit throughout Scandinavia and Europe. A further single, \"[[When You Walk in the Room]]\", was released but met with less success, only peaking at number 34 in the United Kingdom. In January 2007, she sang a live duet on stage with Swedish singer Tommy Körberg at the after party for the final performance of the musical, ''Mamma Mia!'', in Stockholm, at which Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus were also present.\n\nIn 1992, Lyngstad had been asked and chosen to be the chairperson for the environmental organisation ''\"Artister för miljön\"'' (Artists for the Environment) in Sweden. She became chairperson for this organisation from 1992 to 1995. To mark her interests for the environment, she recorded the [[Julian Lennon]] song \"Saltwater\" and performed it live in Stockholm. She arranged and financed summer camps for poor children in Sweden, focusing on environmental and ecological issues. Her environmental work for this organisation led up to the decision to record again. The album ''[[Djupa andetag]]'' (''Deep Breaths'') was released towards the end of 1996 and became a success in Sweden, where it reached number-one. The lyrics for the single from this album, \"Även en blomma\" (\"Even a Flower\"), deal with environmental issues. In 2004, Lyngstad recorded a song called \"The Sun Will Shine Again\", written especially for her and released with former [[Deep Purple]] member [[Jon Lord]]. The couple made several TV performances with this song in Germany. Lyngstad lives a relatively low-profile life but occasionally appears at a party or charity function. On 26 August 1992, she married Prince Heinrich Ruzzo Reuss von Plauen, of the German Reuss family. Reuss von Plauen died of [[lymphoma]] in 1999 at the age of 49. In addition to losing her husband, Lyngstad had also lost her daughter Lise-Lotte in a car crash a year earlier.\n\nOn 5 December 2005,<ref name=\"releasedatedocumentary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/60446/frida-admits-longing-for-abba-reunion|title=Frida Admits Longing For ABBA Reunion|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=29 December 2016}}</ref> [[Universal Music Group|Universal]] released her box set, [[Frida – 4xCD 1xDVD]], consisting of the solo albums she recorded for the Polar Label and the 3{{frac|1|2}}-hour documentary ''Frida – The DVD''. On this DVD, which covers her entire singing career, the viewer is guided by Lyngstad herself through the years from her TV debut in Sweden in 1967 to the TV performances she made in Germany in 2004. Many rare clips are included in the set and each performance is explained by Lyngstad herself. The interview with Lyngstad was filmed in the [[Swiss Alps]] in mid-2005.\n\nLyngstad returned to the recording studio in 2010 to record vocals for the [[Cat Stevens]] song \"[[Morning Has Broken]]\", for Swedish guitarist [[Georg Wadenius]]'s October 2010 album ''Reconnection''. The album, which featured other guest vocalists, reached number 17 in the Swedish charts.<ref>https://acharts.co/album/58457 Date accessed 25 January 2017</ref>\n\nIn May 2013, Fältskog released a solo album entitled ''[[A (Agnetha Fältskog album)|A]]'' through [[Universal Music Group|Universal International]]. In a promotional interview, Fältskog explained that the album was unplanned and it was after she heard the first three songs that she felt that she \"had to do this [record the album]\". She also revealed that she completed singing lessons prior to recording ''A'', as she felt \"a bit rusty\" in her throat. Fältskog stated that she would not be undertaking any tours or live performances in support of the album, explaining: \"I'm not that young anymore.

In the UK and Australia, \"A\" was in the top 100 albums of 2013.\n\n===Resurgence of public interest===\nThe same year the members of ABBA went their separate ways, the French production of a \"tribute\" show (a children's TV musical named ''[[Abbacadabra]]'' using 14 ABBA songs) spawned new interest in the group's music.\n\nAfter receiving little attention during the mid-to-late-1980s, ABBA's music experienced a resurgence in the early 1990s due to the UK synth-pop duo [[Erasure]], who released a cover [[extended play]] featuring versions of ABBA songs which topped the charts in 1992. As [[U2]] arrived in [[Stockholm]] for a concert in June of that year, the band paid homage to ABBA by inviting Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson to join them on stage for a rendition of \"Dancing Queen\", playing guitar and keyboards. September 1992 saw the release of ''[[Gold: Greatest Hits (ABBA album)|ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits]]'', a new compilation album. The single \"[[Dancing Queen]]\" received radio airplay in the UK in the middle of 1992 to promote the album. The song returned to the Top 20 of the UK singles chart in August that year, this time peaking at number 16.\n\nThe enormous interest in the ''ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits'' compilation saw the release of ''[[More ABBA Gold: More ABBA Hits]]'' in 1993.\n\nIn 1994, two Australian [[cult film]]s caught the attention of the world's media, both focusing on admiration for ABBA: ''[[The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]]'' and ''[[Muriel's Wedding]]''. The same year, ''[[Thank You for the Music (album)|Thank You for the Music]]'', a four-disc box set comprising all the group's hits and stand-out album tracks, was released with the involvement of all four members. \"By the end of the twentieth century\", American critic [[Chuck Klosterman]] wrote a decade later, \"it was far more contrarian to hate ABBA than to love them.\"<ref name=\"Klosterman quote\">{{cite book|last=Klosterman|first=Chuck|title=Eating the Dinosaur|year=2009|publisher=Scribner|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4165-4421-0|page=172|authorlink=Chuck Klosterman}} ([https://books.google.com/books?id=T6cFBs1TU9gC&pg=PT203 online copy])</ref>\n\nABBA were soon recognised and embraced by other acts: [[Evan Dando]] of [[the Lemonheads]] recorded a cover version of \"[[Knowing Me, Knowing You]]\";<ref>{{harvnb|Palm|2001|p=504}}</ref> [[Sinéad O'Connor]] and Boyzone's [[Stephen Gately]] have recorded \"[[Chiquitita]]\"; [[Tanita Tikaram]], [[Blancmange (band)|Blancmange]] and [[Steven Wilson]] paid tribute to \"[[The Day Before You Came]]\". [[Cliff Richard]] covered \"[[Lay All Your Love on Me]]\", while [[Dionne Warwick]], Peter Cetera, and [[Celebrity Skin (band)|Celebrity Skin]] recorded their versions of \"[[SOS (ABBA song)|SOS]]\". US alternative-rock musician Marshall Crenshaw has also been known to play a version of \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" in concert appearances, while legendary English [[Latin pop]] songwriter [[Richard Daniel Roman]] has recognised ABBA as a major influence. Swedish metal guitarist [[Yngwie Malmsteen]] covered \"[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!

''ABBA: A Tribute'' coincided with the 25th anniversary celebration and featured 17 songs, some of which were recorded especially for this release. Notable tracks include Go West's \"One of Us\", Army of Lovers \"[[Hasta Mañana]]\", Information Society's \"Lay All Your Love on Me\", Erasure's \"Take a Chance on Me\" (with [[MC Kinky]]), and Lyngstad's a cappella duet with the Real Group of \"Dancing Queen\". A second 12-track album was released in 1999, entitled ''[[ABBAmania]]'', with proceeds going to the Youth Music charity in England. It featured all new cover versions: notable tracks were by Madness (\"Money, Money, Money\"), [[Culture Club]] (\"Voulez-Vous\"), [[the Corrs]] (\"The Winner Takes It All\"), Steps (\"Lay All Your Love on Me\", \"I Know Him So Well\"), and a medley entitled \"Thank ABBA for the Music\" performed by several artists and as featured on the Brits Awards that same year.\n\nIn 1997, an ABBA tribute group was formed, the ABBA Teens, which was subsequently renamed the [[A-Teens]] to allow the group some independence. The group's first album, \"[[The ABBA Generation]]\", consisting solely of ABBA covers reimagined as 1990s pop songs, was a worldwide success and so were subsequent albums. The group disbanded in 2004 due to a gruelling schedule and intentions to go solo.\n\nIn Sweden, the growing recognition of the legacy of Andersson and Ulvaeus resulted in the 1998 ''B & B Concerts'', a tribute concert (with Swedish singers who had worked with the songwriters through the years) showcasing not only their ABBA years, but hits both before and after ABBA. The concert was a success, and was ultimately released on CD. It later toured Scandinavia and even went to Beijing in the People's Republic of China for two concerts.\n\nIn 2000, ABBA was reported to have turned down an offer of approximately US$1,000,000,000 (one billion US dollars) to do a reunion tour consisting of 100 concerts.<ref>Basham, David (2 February 2000) [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1424667/20000202/abba.jhtml \"ABBA Nixes Billion-Dollar Offer To Reunite\"].

Other well-known stars such as [[Rik Mayall]], [[Cher]] and [[Iron Maiden]]'s [[Eddie (mascot)|Eddie]] also made appearances in the video. It was not included in the official DVD release of the Eurovision Contest, but was issued as a separate DVD release, retitled ''The Last Video'' at the request of the former ABBA members.\n\nIn 2005, all four members of ABBA appeared at the Stockholm premiere of the musical ''Mamma Mia!''.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4263745.stm|title= Abba Reunite for Musical Premiere|accessdate=16 July 2008|date= 14 February 2005|publisher= BBC News | location=London}}</ref>\n\nOn 22 October 2005, at the 50th anniversary celebration of the Eurovision Song Contest, \"[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]\" was chosen as the best song in the competition's history.<ref name=50th>{{cite news| publisher= BBC News| date= 23 October 2005 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4366574.stm |title= Abba Win 'Eurovision 50th' Vote|accessdate=20 July 2006}}</ref>\n\nOn 4 July 2008, all four ABBA members were reunited at the Swedish premiere of the film ''[[Mamma Mia!

The PS2 version features 20 ABBA songs, while 25 songs feature on the PS3 version.\n\nOn 22 January 2009, Fältskog and Lyngstad appeared together on stage to receive the Swedish music award ''\"Rockbjörnen\"'' (for \"lifetime achievement\"). In an interview, the two women expressed their gratitude for the honorary award and thanked their fans.\n\nOn 25 November 2009, [[PRS for Music]] announced that the British public voted ABBA as the band they would most like to see re-form.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/6646768/Abba-is-the-band-most-people-want-to-see-reform.html |title=ABBA is the Band Most People Want to See Reform |work=The Daily Telegraph |date= 25 November 2009 |accessdate=31 January 2010 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 January 2010, ABBAWORLD, a 25-room touring exhibition featuring interactive and audiovisual activities, debuted at [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre]] in London.

Omnibus Press {{ISBN|0-86001-950-0}}</ref><ref name=\"Their Own Words 1981, pp 57\"/>\n \nThe band created a basic rhythm track with a drummer, guitarist and bass player, and overlaid other arrangements and instruments. Vocals were then added, and orchestra [[overdubbing|overdubs]] were usually left until last.<ref name=\"Their Own Words 1981, pp 57\"/><ref name=\"Their Own Words 1981, pp 57\"/>\n\nAgnetha and Frida contributed ideas at the studio stage. Benny and Björn played them in the backing tracks and they made comments and suggestions. According to Agnetha, she and Frida had the final say in how the lyrics were shaped. -- \"When we gather around the piano to get our voices tuned up, we often come up with things we can use in the backing vocals.\"<ref name=\"Their Own Words 1981, pp 57\"/> After vocals and overdubs were done, the band took up to five days to mix a song.<ref name=\"Their Own Words 1981, pp 57\" />\n\n===Fashion, style, videos, advertising campaigns===\nABBA was widely noted for the colourful and trend-setting costumes its members wore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wwwc.aftonbladet.se/puls/0002/04/abba.html|title=Aftonbladet puls: ABBA: \"Vi har kläderna att tacka för mycket\"|work=aftonbladet.se}}</ref> The reason for the wild costumes was Swedish tax law. The cost of the clothes was deductible only if they could not be worn other than for performances.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/16/abba-outfits-tax-deduction-bjorn-ulvaeus|title=Abba admit outrageous outfits were worn to avoid tax|work=[[The Guardian]]|last=Bowers|first=Simon|date=16 February 2014|accessdate=13 February 2017}}</ref> Choreography by [[Graham Tainton]] also contributed to their performance style.\n\nThe videos that accompanied some of the band's biggest hits are often cited as being among the earliest examples of the genre. Most of ABBA's videos (and ''ABBA: The Movie'') were directed by [[Lasse Hallström]], who would later direct the films ''[[My Life as a Dog]]'', ''[[The Cider House Rules (film)|The Cider House Rules]]'' and ''[[Chocolat (2000 film)|Chocolat]]''.<ref>''ABBA: Bang a Boomerang''. Australian Broadcasting Corporation, January 2013 (documentary, 57 mins), see 6:00–12:00 min ([http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2642740/ IMDB entry])</ref>\n\nABBA made videos because their songs were hits in many different countries and personal appearances were not always possible. This was also done in an effort to minimise travelling, particularly to countries that would have required extremely long flights. Fältskog and Ulvaeus had two young children and Fältskog, who was also [[Fear of flying|afraid of flying]], was very reluctant to leave her children for such a long time. ABBA's manager, Stig Anderson, realised the potential of showing a simple video clip on television to publicise a single or album, thereby allowing easier and quicker exposure than a concert tour. Some of these videos became classics because of the 1970s-era costumes and early video effects, such as the grouping of the band members in different combinations of pairs, overlapping one singer's profile with the other's full face, and the contrasting of one member against another.\n\nIn 1976, ABBA participated in a high-profile advertising campaign by the Matsushita Electric Industrial (today's [[Panasonic]]), which was designed to promote the brand [[National (brand)|National]]. This campaign was designed initially for Australia, where \"National\" was still the primary brand used by Matsushita, who had not introduced the \"[[Panasonic]]\" brand to Australia yet despite its widespread use in other parts of the world. However, the campaign was also aired in Japan. Five commercials, each approximately one minute long, were produced, each using the \"[[National (brand)|National]] Song\" sung by ABBA, which used the melody and instrumental arrangement of \"[[Fernando (song)|Fernando]]\", adapted with new lyrics promoting National, and working in several slogans used by National in their advertising.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abba-world.net/phenomenon/national/national.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302102624/http://www.abba-world.net/phenomenon/national/national.htm |archivedate=2 March 2012 |title=ABBA: The National Commercial |publisher=Abba-world.net |accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Political position===\nIn September 2010, band members Andersson and Ulvaeus criticised the right-wing [[Danish People's Party]] (DF) for using the ABBA song \"Mamma Mia\" (with modified lyrics) at rallies. The band threatened to file a lawsuit against the DF, saying they never allowed their music to be used politically and that they had absolutely no interest in supporting the party. Their record label Universal Music later said that no legal action would be taken because an agreement had been reached.<ref>{{cite news|title=Abba Anger Over Danish Far-right's Use of Mamma Mia|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11403230|accessdate=5 May 2011|publisher=BBC News|date=24 September 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110409010233/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11403230| archivedate= 9 April 2011 | deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\n==Success in the United States==\nDuring their active career, from 1972 to 1982, ABBA placed twenty singles on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], fourteen of which made the top 40 (13 on the Cashbox Top 100) and ten of which made the Top 20 on both charts. A total of four of those singles reached the Top 10, including \"Dancing Queen\" which reached number-one in April 1977. While \"Fernando\" and \"SOS\" did not break the Top 10 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart, reaching number 13 and 15 respectively, they did reach the Top 10 on Cashbox (\"Fernando\") and Record World (\"SOS\") charts.  Both \"Dancing Queen\" and \"Take A Chance On Me\" were certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for sales of over one million copies each.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130104132513/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database Gold & Platinum Searchable Database – April 19, 2014].

The singles \"Dancing Queen\" and \"Take a Chance on Me\" were certified gold (more than 1&nbsp;million copies sold) by the RIAA.\n\nNine ABBA albums made their way into the top half of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart, with seven of them reaching the Top 50 and four reaching the Top 20. ''ABBA: The Album'' was the highest-charting album of the group's career, peaking at No. 14. Five albums received RIAA gold certification (more than 500,000 copies sold), while three acquired platinum status (selling more than one million copies).\n\nThe album, More Abba Gold, was released in the United States in 1993. It topped the Billboard Top Pop Catalog Albums chart in August 2008, being the group’s first number one album ever on any of the Billboard album charts. It sold 7x Platinum (1x Platinum = one million copies).
